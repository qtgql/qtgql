CHANGELOG
=========

0.119.7 - 2023-06-05
--------------------

This release adds initial support for interfaces. Querying a interface is not yes feasible
though concrete objects are now uses correct inheritance hierarchy.

From this release onwards only types that comply with [`Node`](https://graphql.org/learn/global-object-identification) interface
would be treated as cache-able or update-able.

Contributed by [ניר](https://github.com/nrbnlulu) via [PR #239](https://github.com/qtgql/qtgql/pull/239/)


0.119.6 - 2023-06-04
--------------------

This release sets the first milestones for updates and garbage collection.
The initial PR was for OperationVariables testcase though it was too advanced at this point of the project
because it relied on advanced updated so I first started with scalars and decided to narrow the context of the PR.

The original PR branch is kept as a reference at #232

Contributed by [ניר](https://github.com/nrbnlulu) via [PR #237](https://github.com/qtgql/qtgql/pull/237/)


0.119.5 - 2023-05-31
--------------------

This release adds support for GraphQL enums.

Contributed by [ניר](https://github.com/nrbnlulu) via [PR #229](https://github.com/qtgql/qtgql/pull/229/)


0.119.4 - 2023-05-30
--------------------

Add support list of objects.
When a list is deserialized the instances are mapped based on operation ID
since lists are not part of the [field stability](https://graphql.org/learn/global-object-identification/#field-stability) spec.

Contributed by [ניר](https://github.com/nrbnlulu) via [PR #225](https://github.com/qtgql/qtgql/pull/225/)


0.119.3 - 2023-05-28
--------------------

Adding support for optional object inside an object.

Contributed by [ניר](https://github.com/nrbnlulu) via [PR #224](https://github.com/qtgql/qtgql/pull/224/)


0.119.2 - 2023-05-28
--------------------

This release adds support for nested object types.
operation proxies does not refer to the concrete instance directly
rather they are pointing to an instantiated
proxy of the concrete.

Contributed by [ניר](https://github.com/nrbnlulu) via [PR #222](https://github.com/qtgql/qtgql/pull/222/)


0.119.1 - 2023-05-24
--------------------

0.119.0 - 2023-05-24
--------------------

This release adds support for optional (nullable) scalars.

and initial support for setting variables.
i.e for this query:
```graphql
query MainQuery($returnNone: Boolean! = false) {
  user(retNone: $returnNone) {
    name
    age
    agePoint
    uuid
    birth
  }
}
```

You could set `$returnNone` to `true` like this.

```cpp
auto mq = std::make_shared<mainquery::MainQuery>();
mq->setVariables({true});
mq->fetch();
```

This release adds support for operation errors hooks.
i.e
```python
from qtgqlcodegen.py.runtime.queryhandler import BaseOperationHandler
from qtgqlcodegen.tools import slot

from PySide6.QtCore import QObject

class Foo(QObject):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super().__init__(parent)
        operation: BaseOperationHandler
        operation.error.connect(self.on_error)

        print(err)
```

Contributed by [ניר](https://github.com/nrbnlulu) via [PR #162](https://github.com/nrbnlulu/qtgql/pull/162/)


0.113.1 - 2023-03-22
--------------------

This release fixes an edge case where root types with no id fields
would cause errors on updates.

Contributed by [ניר](https://github.com/nrbnlulu) via [PR #160](https://github.com/nrbnlulu/qtgql/pull/160/)


0.113.0 - 2023-03-22
--------------------

This release adds initial support for mutations.

- [x] Mutation handler (on par with query handler).
- [x] commit slot. - on par with `refetch()` / `fetch()`
- [x] Support variables
Every operation would generate <OperationName>Variables type, this type would be the property
The commit slot would have the types arguments on it, and for every type is not a plain JS type
we would generate a factory slot (accessible from QML), those types would be transformed to dictionaries and further on to JSON.

  - [x] scalars
  - [x] CustomScalars
  - [x] objectTypes
- [x] Should have a `property` for `operationOnFlight` (maybe queries as well)

- [x] Test usage from QML Already covered by query tests, all operations use the same base class.
- [ ] <s>Update docs.</s> Would update in a separate PR when updating major version.
- [x] if there are variables for an operation than it shouldn't auto fetch itself (when used in QML)
we should provide something like `property bool autofetch: false`

### Notes:
- This release also made `BaseQueryHandler` not a singleton, because you could have different
filters (on different handlers). Instead of `UseQuery{operationName: '...'}`
- There would be `Consume<operationName>{}` QQuickItem that would internally use
the generated <operationName> handler. By using this Item you declare that as long as this component lives
the data it retains wouldn't be gc'eed.
- This release changed the data property on operation handlers to handlerData.

This release adds support for types without `ID!` field.
fixes [#115](https://github.com/nrbnlulu/qtgql/issues/115)

Contributed by [ניר](https://github.com/nrbnlulu) via [PR #116](https://github.com/nrbnlulu/qtgql/pull/116/)


0.110.0 - 2023-03-01
--------------------

This release adds support for updates.
It does this by generating for each query handler
an object that represents the selections for this query.
Then if the data is being compared against local data as follows

1. __builtin scalars__ - compared against the current value.
2. __custom scalars__ - By default compared against the inner value of the custom scalar.
3. __object_type__ - will compare against each field (generated on `update()`),
 - Note: if the object had the same ID! then the fields setter should not be called since the updates only
  occur at the child level, thus avoiding unnecessary updates.
edge cased:
 - new id reached: resolution -> create a new object and replace the pointer with the field setter.
 - field was null before (ATM objecttypes are the only real fields that can be null): resolution -> use setter on this field
 -
4. __unions__ - if `__typename` is different will cause a whole update, else similar to (3)
5. __enums__ - compare against the enum value / name (which the same string).
6. __lists a.k.a models__ -- since lists just store a pointer (or a key in the store) to a node and the node itself
already compared when `.from_dict` called on the raw-node,
we should just compare if the pointers points the right index so first crop the length of the list
to the length of the arrived data, then for each index compare the `ID!` and replace correspondingly if ID matched
call `update()` on that node.



This release also introduce `typename` property on each object type.
This is used by unions deserializers and can be useful for rendering specific component
based on the typename.

0.109.0 - 2023-02-22

All CRUD operations will occur on store level.

Contributed by [ניר](https://github.com/nrbnlulu) via [PR #106](https://github.com/nrbnlulu/qtgql/pull/106/)


0.108.0 - 2023-02-20
--------------------

This release adds initial implementation for type-store,
each type would have a dedicated store, and it would be used to CRUD
the instances.

0.107.0 - 2023-02-20
--------------------

This release adds `UseQuery` instead of using just the singleton generated type.
```qml
import generated.<Environment name> 1.0 as G
G.UseQuery{
    operationName: 'MainQuery'
    Text{
        text: G.MainQuery.completed? G.MainQuery.data: "loading..."
    }
}
```
This release also impose a new style for declaring operations.
User would need to provide a schema.graphql and operations.graphql
under the same directory and import the operation names from qml.
