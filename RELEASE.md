Release type: patch

This release sets the first milestones for updates and garbage collection.
The initial PR was for OperationVariables testcase though it was too advanced at this point of the project
because it relied on advanced updated so I first started with scalars and decided to narrow the context of the PR.

The original PR branch is kept as a reference at #232
